description: Runs end-to-end Domino orchestration workflows from a single entry point using Cursor subagents, hooks, and file-backed runtime state. Use when the user wants a multi-step task planned, implemented, reviewed, repaired, verified, and persisted automatically from one Domino invocation.

# Domino

## Purpose

Use this skill as the single global entry point for Domino workflows.

This skill replaces the old slash-command chain:

- `/domino`
- `/orchestrator`
- `/orchestrator-parallel`
- `/agent-executor`
- `/agent-debugger`
- `/agent-reviewer`
- `/merge-review`
- `/verify`
- `/memory-load`
- `/memory-save`

Those are now internal workflow roles. Domino should not ask the user to run them manually.

## Runtime Files

Domino uses file-backed state in the active workspace:

- `.cursor/domino-plan.md`
- `.cursor/domino-runtime.json`
- `.cursor/tasks/task-*.md`
- `.cursor/parallel-plan.md`
- `.cursor/project_state.md`
- `.cursor/context_summary.md`

## Helper Scripts

Use these deterministic helpers:

- `python3 ~/.cursor/skills/domino/scripts/domino_runtime.py ensure --workspace "<workspace-root>"`
- `python3 ~/.cursor/skills/domino/scripts/domino_runtime.py start --workspace "<workspace-root>"`
- `python3 ~/.cursor/skills/domino/scripts/domino_runtime.py read-state --workspace "<workspace-root>"`
- `python3 ~/.cursor/skills/domino/scripts/domino_runtime.py mark-dispatch --workspace "<workspace-root>" --role "<role>" --task-id "<task-id>"`
- `python3 ~/.cursor/skills/domino/scripts/domino_runtime.py set-status --workspace "<workspace-root>" --status "<status>"`
- `python3 ~/.cursor/skills/domino/scripts/domino_runtime.py complete --workspace "<workspace-root>"`
- `python3 ~/.cursor/skills/domino/scripts/domino_runtime.py next-task --workspace "<workspace-root>"`
- `python3 ~/.cursor/skills/domino/scripts/domino_runtime.py normalize-result --workspace "<workspace-root>" --task-id "<task-id>"`

If the workspace root is unclear, resolve it first with `pwd`.

## Startup

At the start of every Domino run:

1. Resolve the workspace root.
2. Run `ensure`.
3. Read `.cursor/project_state.md` and `.cursor/context_summary.md` if they exist.
4. Read `.cursor/domino-runtime.json` and `.cursor/domino-plan.md` if they exist.
5. If there is no active Domino runtime state, run `start`.

## Ambiguity Gate

Default behavior is auto-start, not approval-seeking.

Only stop if one high-impact ambiguity would materially change:

- architecture
- file layout
- data shape
- destructive behavior
- acceptance criteria

When the decision is discrete and can be expressed as 2-4 options, use structured selection instead of plain text.

When the decision is open-ended, ask one plain-text question.

Do not ask more than one high-impact question at a time.

## Strategy

Choose one of these modes:

- `Sequential`
- `Parallel`
- `Repair`
- `Review-only`
- `Hybrid`

Persist the chosen strategy in `.cursor/domino-plan.md`.

## Worker Roles

Domino should use subagents instead of slash-command jumps.

Use these internal roles:

- `Planner` — produces standard task specs for sequential, repair, or review-only work
- `ParallelPlanner` — produces standard task specs for parallel waves
- `Executor` — implements one task spec
- `Debugger` — fixes one task spec
- `Reviewer` — reviews one task spec
- `Verifier` — performs final end-to-end verification
- `MemorySaver` — persists `project_state.md` and `context_summary.md`

Detailed role contracts live in [reference.md](reference.md).

## Dispatch Rules

### Sequential, Repair, Review-only

1. Dispatch the `Planner` role to write standard `.cursor/tasks/task-*.md` files.
2. Use `next-task` to select the next unblocked task.
3. Dispatch the assigned worker role.
4. Before dispatching any worker subagent, run:

```bash
python3 ~/.cursor/skills/domino/scripts/domino_runtime.py mark-dispatch --workspace "<workspace-root>" --role "<role>" --task-id "<task-id>"
```

5. Let the `subagentStop` hook auto-submit the next `/domino ...` follow-up.
6. After the queue is complete, set status to `verify_pending` and allow the `stop` hook to continue the flow.

### Parallel, Hybrid

1. Dispatch the `ParallelPlanner` role to write `.cursor/tasks/task-*.md` and `.cursor/parallel-plan.md`.
2. If isolation is required, prefer isolated worker subagents or best-of-n-style isolated runners for each wave task.
3. Before dispatching each worker subagent, run `mark-dispatch`.
4. Let the `subagentStop` hook auto-submit the next `/domino ...` follow-up.
5. If a wave needs merge-style reconciliation, have Domino do that work inside the main loop using `.cursor/parallel-plan.md` and task results.
6. When the final active segment is done, set status to `verify_pending`.

## Verify And Memory Save

When all planned tasks are done:

1. Set status to `verify_pending`
2. End the turn so the `stop` hook can auto-submit the verify continuation
3. Run the `Verifier` role
4. If verification passes, set status to `memory_save_pending`
5. End the turn so the `stop` hook can auto-submit the memory-save continuation
6. Run the `MemorySaver` role
7. Call `complete`

## Hook Contract

Domino relies on user-level hooks:

- `subagentStop` continues the workflow after worker completion
- `stop` continues the workflow for verify and memory-save phases

Do not ask the user to manually continue the chain unless execution is blocked.

## Required Runtime State Transitions

Use these statuses in `.cursor/domino-runtime.json`:

- `running`
- `waiting_for_worker`
- `verify_pending`
- `memory_save_pending`
- `blocked`
- `completed`

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Do not tell the user to manually run an old slash command as the next step.
- Do not invent ad-hoc task files outside `.cursor/tasks/`.
- Carry `Domino assumptions` and `User decisions` into task specs.
- Require worker results to include `Constraint check`.
- Re-read `.cursor/domino-plan.md` and `.cursor/domino-runtime.json` on every continuation turn.
- If blocked, stop and ask exactly one high-impact question.
